Set 1
Large set of organic compounds which is a subset of the Downloadable Structure Files of NCI Open Database Compounds. The subset was generated by the restriction: maximal number of rings is 4

Set 2
Set of molecules widely used for organic synthesis. It includes different inhibitors, stabilizers, precursors, solvents, herbicides, amino acids, drugs and others

Set 3
Molecules with small sizes which are widely used drugs, solvents, amino acids, etc

Set 4
A structure set taken from reference [5] (M. Sitzmann, W.D. Ihlenfeldt, M. Nicklaus, J. Comput. Aided Mol. Des. 2010, 24, 521-551) used for comparison of the canonical forms obtained from different software packages

Set 5
The set contains 10 682 structures used for estimating the time for which all tautomers are generated
